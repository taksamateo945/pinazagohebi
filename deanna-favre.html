Besides that, there is no information about her parent’s profession and her childhood days.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-170132 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Deanna-Favre-posing-with-her-husband-Brett-Favre.jpg alt="Deanna Favre" width=650 height=718 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-170132 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Deanna Favre posing with her husband Brett Favre (Source: Instagram)</p><p>Deanna Favre studied and completed her schooling at the Hancock North Central High School. After that, she received a basketball scholarship and attended a community college in Poplarville, Mississippi in 1986. Later, she transferred to the University of Southern Mississippi and received a BA in Exercise Science in December 1994.</p><h2><span id=Professional_life>Professional life</span></h2><p>Deanna Favre started her career by selling pink Green Bay Packers hats to raise money and awareness for breast cancer in 2005. Moreover, her Green Bay Packers hats outsold regular Packers hats during the first half of 2005. She started working for breast cancer after she was diagnosed with breast cancer in October 2004 which could soon expand. Her family and friends did not give up hope and helped her during her treatment after the shocking revelation.</p><p>Moreover, she underwent five months of chemotherapy and won her battle against breast cancer. Additionally, she also received a number of letters from women all over the country about how they became motivated to check their health after hearing her story. After that, she started working as an activist who would help to raise awareness of breast cancer following her recovery.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-170135 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Deanna-Favres-book-Dont-bet-against-me.jpg alt="Deanna Favre" width=650 height=1010 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-170135 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Deanna Favre’s book Don’t bet against me (Source: Amazon)</p><p>After raising money, she took a step further and established her own charity called The Deanna Favre Hope Foundation. Moreover, she currently served as the CEO of The Deanna Favre Hope Foundation. Her organization supports education about breast cancer besides helping women who have the same problem as her. Moreover, she also works in running her husband’s charity called The Brett Favre Fourward Foundation. Additionally, her husband’s foundation also raised more than $3 million to help disabled and disadvantaged children in Mississippi and Wisconsin.</p><p>She has also authored two books about her experience with breast cancer apart from being an activist. In October 2007, Tyndale House Publishers published her first autobiography, “Don’t Bet Against Me Beating the Odds Against Breast Cancer and in Life”. Later, she released her second book titled “The Cure of the Chronic Life Overcoming the Hopelessness That Holds You Back” with Shane Stanford.</p><h4>Achievements and Net Worth</h4><p>Talking about her awards and nominations, there is no information about her awards. Moreover, we can assume that she will win some of them from her work in charity and as an author.</p><p>She might have garnered a significant amount of money from her work as an author. However, she has not revealed her estimated net worth and likes to work for several charities works.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Status>Relationship Status</span></h2><p>Deanna Favre met her future husband <strong>Brett Favre</strong> in 1983 while they were growing up in Kiln.
