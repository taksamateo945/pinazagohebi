They&nbsp;officially announced Tuesday that they had released the quarterback.&nbsp;</p>Houston Texans <span class=acct>@HoustonTexans</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>The #Texans have released QB Brian Hoyer and waived QB B.J. Daniels from the active roster.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rapoport</a> noted the Texans were looking for a potential trade partner but "did right by [Hoyer]" by releasing him.</p><p>"It's part of the business,"&nbsp;<span>Hoyer said, per&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Berman</a><span>&nbsp;of Fox 26. "</span>To be honest, I've just got to worry about my family and moving on to the next part."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dom Cosentino</a>&nbsp;of NJ.com reported that Hoyer "<span>is scheduled to fly to&nbsp;</span><span>New Jersey on Tuesday for a meeting with the Jets in Florham Park that&nbsp;will continue into Wednesday, according to a person with knowledge of the situation." <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Newsday Sports</a>&nbsp;confirmed the report.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Cosentino noted that "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason La Canfora</a>&nbsp;of CBS Sports and Boomer Esiason of WFAN radio were&nbsp;first to report Hoyer's pending visit to the Jets."</span></p><p>Hoyer, 30, was due to make $4 million in base salary and had a&nbsp;<span>$859,375 roster bonus due for 2016. None of that money was guaranteed, so Houston will not have a cap hit. The team <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">signed</a> Osweiler for four years and $72 million, and considering that price tag, paying his backup $4 million didn't look like a smart use of resources.</span></p><p><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aaron Wilson</a> of the&nbsp;Houston Chronicle&nbsp;reported the Texans ultimately saved $5.015 million against the salary cap and are $11.451 million under the cap limit after the release.</span></p><p><span>Hoyer threw for 2,606 yards and 19 touchdowns against seven interceptions in 2015. While those were decent stats, Hoyer was benched at multiple points for Ryan Mallett and never engendered much faith from head coach Bill O'Brien.</span></p><p><span>By the time Houston sent Mallett packing, Hoyer wound up spending the rest of his season struggling with injuries. He appeared in only 11 games overall, with T.J. Yates and Brandon Weeden each getting turns toward the end of the season. His return for Houston's playoff game could not have gone worse, as Hoyer threw four interceptions and fumbled twice (losing one) in a 30-0 loss to the <a href=#>Kansas City Chiefs</a>.</span></p><p>"There’s no one who feels lower than I do right now, but one day does not make my career. One game does not make my career,"&nbsp;Hoyer said, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael David Smith</a>&nbsp;of Pro Football Talk.</p><p>For his career, Hoyer has appeared in 43 games for four franchises. He has a touchdown-to-interception ratio of 38-26. His teams are 15-11 in games in which he's been the starting quarterback.</p><p>The Texans undoubtedly want a better long-term option under center, but Hoyer wouldn't have been a terrible choice.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Football Outsiders'</a>&nbsp;DYAR (defense-adjusted yards above replacement) and DVOA (defense-adjusted value over average) metrics ranked him 20th among quarterbacks last season, and "average" is probably good enough for a playoff berth with Houston's defense.&nbsp;</p><p>Hoyer will now be playing for his third team in as many seasons. The <a href=#>New York Jets</a>&nbsp;are the only potential suitors where Hoyer could wind up as a starter, but their stalled negotiations with Ryan Fitzpatrick have to end at some point. As the Texans learned firsthand last season, replacing Fitzpatrick with Hoyer isn't an ideal outcome.</p><p>Hoyer is a serviceable enough backup that he won't have any trouble finding work. Half the teams in the league would likely improve their backup situations by signing him.&nbsp;</p><p>As it stands, the Texans obviously want to make it clear Osweiler is their guy going forward. Releasing Hoyer now just makes things easier.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW9pZ2qAdHnBq6Capl2dvLqx0WapnqSVlsCmsIybsGasla2ur7%2BMpZitnaOpeqS7zKacp6yjYq6vsIyrnJqbpJ68rw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f2617533-brian-hoyer-released-by-texans-latest-comments-and-reaction.html&text=Brian%20Hoyer%20Released%20by%20Texans%3a%20Latest%20Comments%20and%20Reaction%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Highlights%2c%20Stats%2c%20and%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f2617533-brian-hoyer-released-by-texans-latest-comments-and-reaction.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f2617533-brian-hoyer-released-by-texans-latest-comments-and-reaction.html&title=Brian%20Hoyer%20Released%20by%20Texans%3a%20Latest%20Comments%20and%20Reaction%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Highlights%2c%20Stats%2c%20and%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f2617533-brian-hoyer-released-by-texans-latest-comments-and-reaction.html&title=Brian%20Hoyer%20Released%20by%20Texans%3a%20Latest%20Comments%20and%20Reaction%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Highlights%2c%20Stats%2c%20and%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f2617533-brian-hoyer-released-by-texans-latest-comments-and-reaction.html&title=Brian%20Hoyer%20Released%20by%20Texans%3a%20Latest%20Comments%20and%20Reaction%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Highlights%2c%20Stats%2c%20and%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f2617533-brian-hoyer-released-by-texans-latest-comments-and-reaction.html&description=Brian%20Hoyer%20Released%20by%20Texans%3a%20Latest%20Comments%20and%20Reaction%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Highlights%2c%20Stats%2c%20and%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./brielle-biermann-poses-in-a-black-bikini-after-losing-a-few-extra-pounds-due-to-jaw-surgery.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brielle Biermann poses in a black bikini after losing 'a few extra pounds' due to jaw surgery">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./leading-all-other-competitors-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Leading all other competitors">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
