Timmy’s love and friendship for his godparent family goes very deep as no magic could erase the bond he shares with them, shown in Timmy’s Secret Wish.</p><p>Keeping this in view, Did Timmy Turner wished to stop aging?</p><p>In the television movie, “Timmy’s Secret Wish”, Timmy Turner, along with the rest of Dimmsdale, is aged fifty years quickly by Father Time at the orders of the Fairy Council. This was because they had learned <b>Timmy had wished secretly to stay ten years old</b> fifty years ago.</p><p>Furthermore, Why is Vicky so evil?</p><p>In “Vicky Loses Her Icky”, the cause of her evilness is attributed to <b>an evil bug that crawled up her butt</b>. In the episode “The Switch Glitch”, she was actually nice as a five-year-old, but quickly turned bad when she wanted revenge on Timmy for being a mean babysitter.</p><p>Is Vicky in love with Timmy?</p><p>Love at First Height</p><p>When Timmy wished himself into a hunky sixteen-year-old, <b>Vicky quickly fell in love with him</b>, and her personality started to resemble her sister Tootie’s when she chased Timmy around the amusement park trying to smooch him.</p><p>Secondly, Is Timmy Turner selfish?</p><p><b>Timmy’s wishes are primarily selfish</b>. He makes wishes to get himself out of trouble or to make himself happy. There have only been a few times when he’s made wishes to make his friends happy.

Without a doubt, one of their worst parenting examples is their choice for a babysitter. … Part of the reason they don’t notice anything amiss is that they don’t pay much attention to Timmy at all.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_did_Timmy_Turner_have_a_crush_on></span><strong>Who did Timmy Turner have a crush on?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Timmy has an obvious crush on <b>Trixie</b>, but she frequently rejects him.
