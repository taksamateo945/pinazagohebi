Drake’s son, the offspring of the globally renowned rapper Drake, has recently stepped into the limelight with the release of his debut music and a captivating music video for “My Man Freestyle.”</p><p>Drake is one of the most successful and influential rappers in the world, but he is also a proud father to his son, Adonis Graham.</p><p>Adonis, who turned six years old on October 11, 2023, surprised everyone with his debut song and music video, “My Man Freestyle”.</p><p>The song showcases Adonis’ rap skills and personality, as well as his bond with his father and his love for basketball.</p><p>In this blog, we will explore who Adonis Graham is, how <a href=#>Drake</a> confirmed his fatherhood, what “My Man Freestyle” is about, how Drake supported his son’s musical venture, and what are the reactions to Adonis’ song.</p><h2>Who is Adonis Graham?</h2><p>Adonis Graham is the son of Drake and Sophie Brussaux, a former adult film star and artist.</p><p>He was born on October 11, 2017, in France.</p><p>His full name is Adonis Mahbed Graham, which means “lord” or “ruler” in Greek.</p><p>He has blue eyes and curly blonde hair, which he inherited from his mother’s side of the family.</p><p>Drake and Brussaux met in Amsterdam in January 2017, shortly after Drake’s split from Jennifer Lopez.</p><p>They had a brief fling, which resulted in Brussaux’s pregnancy.</p><p>However, Drake initially denied that he was the father of Adonis, and even accused Brussaux of lying and extorting him.</p><p>Brussaux claimed that she had proof that Drake was the father, and hired a lawyer to seek child support from him.</p><h2>How did Drake confirm his fatherhood?</h2><p>Drake confirmed that he was the father of Adonis in June 2018, when he released his fifth studio album, Scorpion.</p><p>On the album, Drake addressed his son and his relationship with Brussaux on several songs, such as:</p><p>“Emotionless”, “8 Out of 10”, and “March 14”.</p><p>On the latter track, Drake revealed that he only met his son once at Christmas time, and that he was trying to co-parent with Brussaux despite their differences.</p><p>He also expressed his regret for hiding his son from the world, and his hope for a better future for him.</p><p>Drake also shared photos of his son for the first time on Instagram in March 2020, along with a heartfelt caption about missing his family and friends amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>He wrote: “I love and miss my beautiful family and friends and I can’t wait for the joyful day when we are all able to reunite.”</p><p>Since then, Drake has posted more pictures and videos of Adonis on social media, showing their close and loving relationship.</p><h2>What is “My Man Freestyle”?</h2><p>“My Man Freestyle” is Adonis’ debut song, which he released on his sixth birthday, October 11, 2023.</p><p>The song is produced by Boi-1da, one of Drake’s longtime collaborators, and features Adonis rapping over a catchy beat.</p><p>The lyrics are mostly in English, but also include some French words and phrases, reflecting Adonis’ bilingual background.</p><p>The song is about Adonis’ confidence and swagger, as well as his admiration for his father and his passion for basketball.</p><p><strong>Some of the notable lines from the song are:</strong></p><ul><li>“I’m Adonis Graham, I’m the man / I got blue eyes like my maman / I got curly hair like my dad / I got big dreams like my granddad”</li><li>“I love my daddy, he’s the best / He always gives me hugs and kisses / He always makes me laugh and smile / He always teaches me new things”</li><li>“I love basketball, it’s my sport / I play like Kawhi Leonard / I shoot like Steph Curry / I dunk like LeBron James”</li><li>“I’m a star in the making / I’m a legend in the waiting / I’m a king in the rising / I’m a rap god in the training”</li></ul><p>The song is available on all streaming platforms, such as Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, etc.</p><h2>How did Drake support his son’s musical venture?</h2><p>Drake supported his son’s musical venture by appearing in the music video for “My Man Freestyle”, which was released on October 12, 2023.</p><p>The music video is directed by Director X, another one of Drake’s frequent collaborators, and features Adonis rapping in various locations, such as a recording studio, a basketball court, a playground, and a mansion.</p><p>Drake joins Adonis in some of the scenes, showing their father-son chemistry and having fun together.</p><p>The music video also features a cameo from Toronto Raptors rookie <a href=#>Gradey Dick</a>, who is Adonis’ godfather and Drake’s close friend.</p><p>Dick plays basketball with Adonis and Drake, and gives Adonis a Raptors jersey with his name and number on it.</p><p>Drake is a well-known fan and ambassador of the Raptors, and has often brought Adonis to their games.</p><p>The music video has over 100 million views on YouTube, and has received positive reviews from critics and fans alike.</p><h2>What are the reactions to Adonis’ song?</h2><p>Adonis’ song has received a lot of reactions from fans, critics, and celebrities on social media and other
