From our perspective, these representatives don't seem to work for an individual client like Caitlin. They seem to work for the NBA mob, as their client list is a who's who of NBA players. Do we expect them to prioritize Caitlin over the NBA—the top employer of their most highly-paid clients?</i></p><p><i>"The NBA commands by fear, and they make sure their industry of agents, lawyers, managers, and networks stay in line. And that line is to prevent BIG3 success, even if it stunts the growth of women's basketball."</i></p><p>BIG3 has been in existence since 2017 and has significant financial backing with legendary rapper Ice Cube as co-owner, but it hasn't come close to rising to the level of popularity of the NBA or even the WNBA.</p><p>While the three-on-three nature of the league makes for fun, fast-paced action, rosters are primarily populated by former NBA players in the twilight of their careers.</p><p>The WNBA undoubtedly offers Clark a more competitive environment and a chance to prove her ability against the best players in women's basketball.</p><p>Of course, Kwatinetz's comments suggest that Clark could have tried to play in both BIG3 and the WNBA, but given the commitment to excellence she displayed at Iowa, it is possible Clark did not want to split her focus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYW2AdoGMsKWbmaNisKK106Wgp2WToa6zt4ywpq6klKuybr7EnJyirpWZenKBzGaZop9jYrCwutOrmJysXaSzp7HRZqqasaNisLB5xaisp5yVpw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10118355-wnbas-caitlin-clark-wouldve-received-15m-big3-contract-offer-says-co-founder.html&text=WNBA%27s%20Caitlin%20Clark%20Would%27ve%20Received%20%2415M%2b%20BIG3%20Contract%20Offer%2c%20Says%20Co-Founder%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Hi&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10118355-wnbas-caitlin-clark-wouldve-received-15m-big3-contract-offer-says-co-founder.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10118355-wnbas-caitlin-clark-wouldve-received-15m-big3-contract-offer-says-co-founder.html&title=WNBA%27s%20Caitlin%20Clark%20Would%27ve%20Received%20%2415M%2b%20BIG3%20Contract%20Offer%2c%20Says%20Co-Founder%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Hi" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10118355-wnbas-caitlin-clark-wouldve-received-15m-big3-contract-offer-says-co-founder.html&title=WNBA%27s%20Caitlin%20Clark%20Would%27ve%20Received%20%2415M%2b%20BIG3%20Contract%20Offer%2c%20Says%20Co-Founder%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Hi" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10118355-wnbas-caitlin-clark-wouldve-received-15m-big3-contract-offer-says-co-founder.html&title=WNBA%27s%20Caitlin%20Clark%20Would%27ve%20Received%20%2415M%2b%20BIG3%20Contract%20Offer%2c%20Says%20Co-Founder%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Hi" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10118355-wnbas-caitlin-clark-wouldve-received-15m-big3-contract-offer-says-co-founder.html&description=WNBA%27s%20Caitlin%20Clark%20Would%27ve%20Received%20%2415M%2b%20BIG3%20Contract%20Offer%2c%20Says%20Co-Founder%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Hi" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./erika-anderson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Erika Anderson Net Worth 2024, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./gary-oliva.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gary Oliva, The Sex Offender Who Claimed He Killed JonBent Ramsey">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
