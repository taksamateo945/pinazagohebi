However, what started as a promising and happy marriage began to fade after a couple of years, and after almost 10 years of marriage and mutual life she filed for divorce in October 2015, simultaneously asking for sole custody of their two children. As she stated, the main reasons for the separation were the “irreconcilable differences” between the two, as well as May’s alleged physical abusiveness. However, the divorce was never finalized, as Ralphie May died from hypertensive cardiovascular disease on the 6th October 2017 at the age of 45 in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I selected this photo because Ralphie looks like an angel with a halo. <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/vsnSIpgcIp</a></p><p>— Lahna Turner (@LahnaTurner) <a rel=nofollow href=#>October 6, 2017</a></p><h2><span id=Lahna_Turner8217s_Net_Worth>Lahna Turner’s Net Worth</span></h2><p>Have you ever wondered how much wealth this <a rel=nofollow href=#>popular</a> American comedian has accumulated so far?
