This is because the reality TV star herself did not talk much about her birthplace for a long time. However, we now know she was raised in Miami, a coastal metropolis and the county seat of Miami-Dade County in South Florida.</p><p>We know this because Aja revealed this information herself in an Instagram post she made in October 2022. In the post, she explained that she was raised in Miami and that she loved attending homecomings. It is also believed that Miami is where Aja was born.</p><p>Aja Crowder was born on the 10th day of June 1986. This means she is currently 37 years old. As we have mentioned, she grew up in Miami and was raised by her mother. She developed a very close relationship with her mother and was quite inseparable from the woman. Aja has often explained that her mother has always been her rock and that she has always been in awe of the woman who did everything to make sure she was raised well.</p><p>Aja was also very close to her grandmother while growing up. She would later explain that her grandmother played a very big part in raising and molding her into who she eventually became in life. Her closeness to her grandmother grew as she got older, and even as an adult, she kept visiting the older woman in Opa-Locka, a city located in Miami-Dade County, Florida, where the woman lived. When Aja’s grandmother died in 2020, she was devastated and felt like a huge part of her had left her.</p><h3><strong>Aja Crowder Didn’t Know Who Her Father Was Until She Was A Full Grown Woman</strong></h3><p>Interestingly, Aja Crowder did not know who her father was as a child. What happened was that, in the early 1980s, Aja’s mother met a man called Bruno, and they became friends. They remained friends for quite a while, but after some time, they eventually developed feelings for each other and started a relationship.</p><p>However, their relationship was very short-lived, and they soon parted ways and lost touch with each other. As fate would have it, Aja’s mother became pregnant just before she and Bruno parted ways but did not know this at the time, so she didn’t get to tell Bruno that she was with their child.</p><p>When Aja’s mother found out she was pregnant, she and Bruno had already parted ways and had lost touch so she could not reach out to him with the news of the pregnancy. She tried searching for him but failed to find him. Eventually, Aja was born on June 10, 1986, and was raised by her mother so she never met her father at all as a child.</p><p>However, even though she never met her father as a child, Aja later explained that she never felt like she lacked a father figure in her life because her mother did a great job raising her. Everything she needed to develop into a well-bred woman was provided for her by her mother. Also, she had the support of her grandparents, who doted on her and ensured she was properly taken care of.</p><p>Interestingly, while growing up, Aja Crowder thought that the surname on her birth certificate was that of her father, whom her mother didn’t want to tell her about. However, during her sophomore year at the university, she found out the very hard truth; the name on her birth certificate was not her father’s. She found out that her father didn’t even know she existed because he never got to know she was born.</p><p>She discovered this when her mother eventually opened up on the matter and told her about Bruno and that he is her father, who does not know about her. Aja was not hurt by the revelation but became very curious about meeting the man who fathered her.</p><h3><strong>Aja Embarked On A Search For Her Father</strong></h3><p>When Aja Crowder found out the truth about her real father, she decided to look for him and connect with him. However, he was nowhere to be found, and no one close to her knew where he was. All that she knew about him was that his name was Bruno and that he attended Miami High School in the 1970s.</p><p>When Aja got married to her husband, Channing Crowder, the urge to find her father became even more overwhelming. So, she started her search. She spent years looking for the man who was her father but didn’t succeed. She visited the places where he lived as a younger man and asked different people questions about him. But no one knew where he was. What was crazier about the entire ordeal was that her father, Bruce didn’t even know that she existed because he never got a chance to know that she had been conceived before parting ways with Aja’s mother.</p><p>After years of searching, Aja became exhausted and almost gave up. But, her husband Channing came up with the idea to take the search to Twitter. And this was what they did. Channing tweeted about Bruce and asked the Twitter community to help find the man.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Could y'all plz help my wife and I find her dad. Name is Bruno,54, Cuban dude, attended Miami High late 70s. PlzRT <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/nmsqHIDLj6</a></p><p>— Channing Crowder (@OfficialCrowder) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">December 13, 2015</a></p><p>After Channing tweeted about Bruce, Aja Crowder also went to a local radio station and told her story there, urging people to help her find her father. This eventually yielded a positive result because a few days after Channing put out the tweet, Aja got a call from Bruce himself. She was completely blown away. The man she had spent so many years looking for had finally been found. She felt like a huge gap in her life had finally been filled.</p><p>After the call from her father, they eventually got together, and Aja saw her father’s face for the very first time. Bruno later explained that when he first laid his eyes on Aja, he realized she was his daughter. Today, Aja and her father are very close, and he is absolutely fond of her children, who are, of course, his grandkids.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/11/58822344_2329871530621900_7863277457832830563_n.jpg><h3><strong>She Actively Played Tennis At Howard University</strong></h3><p>Aja Crowder was a very active person right from when she was just a child.

According to some reports, Aja was quite a good tennis player in high school.</p><p>After completing her high school education, Aja Crowder proceeded to attend Howard University, a private, federally chartered historically black research university in Washington, D.C. As expected, while she was at Howard University, Aja continued to play tennis as a Division 1 athlete.</p><p>Aja Crowder did not pursue a career as a professional tennis player. It is not clear why she chose to discontinue her passion for playing tennis.</p><h2><strong>How Aja Crowder and Channing Crowder Met</strong></h2><p>Aja Crowder and Channing Crowder first met each other in 2009. They met at a charity event that took place at a radio station where Aja was working at the time. Channing was struck by her beauty and decided to reach out. They got talking soon after, and Aja also became fascinated by him.</p><p>However, Aja later revealed that even though she was taken by Channing’s good looks, she did not make it easy for him the day they met. She made sure she took her time by evading him for a while at the event just to see if he was really serious with her. Channing persisted, and so she fell for him eventually.</p><p>Aja and Channing were head over heels in love with each when they eventually started dating. Aja explained that the whole experience felt like they were designed to be with each other from the beginning of time. They went to different places together and created some truly incredible memories.</p><p>One thing that really helped them bond very quickly was their mutual love for adventure. Sometimes they would just take time off from whatever it was they were doing and just go out to do something crazy. Something they had not done before. These experiences helped them to really bond.</p><h2><strong>Aja Became Channing Crowder’s Wife in 2011</strong></h2><p>After a few years of dating, Aja Crowder and Channing Crowder decided to tie the knot as a married couple. They eventually became husband and wife in 2011. It is not clear how exactly their wedding was held and where it took place as this information has largely remained out of reach.</p><p>However, it is believed that the event was attended by family and friends as well as several other celebrities, considering how popular Channing Crowder is as a football player. The couple has remained together ever since they tied the knot as husband and wife, and it appears that their love is waxing stronger.</p><h3><strong>They Have Three Children Together</strong></h3><p>The marriage between Aja Crowder and Channing Crowder has been a fruitful one; the couple is now parents to three lovely children, two boys and a girl, whom they love with everything they have. Aja and Channing’s three children are Channing Crowder III, Ava Milan Crowder, and Chaz Lee Randolph Crowder.</p><p>Channing III, their first child was born in 2011, the same year they got married. As a matter of fact, Aja was actually heavily pregnant during their wedding. Channing III is fast growing into a handsome young man and is doted on by both his parents.</p><p>Aja and her husband, Channing’s second child, Ava, was born in 2013, about two years after their wedding. Their last child, Chaz, was born in 2020. When Aja, who is very active on social media, became pregnant with Chaz, she made sure she let all her followers what was happening and kept them updated with her pregnancy journey by making frequent posts on Instagram. When Chaz was eventually born, she let everyone know about it and got tons of congratulatory messages flooding her social media pages.</p><h3><strong>Aja and Channing are Still Going Strong</strong></h3><p>Aja Crowder and her husband, Channing Crowder, have now been married for over a decade, but they are still going very strong. As a matter of fact, the couple seems to be renewing their romance on a daily basis. Based on what the couple posts about each other on social media, it is clear that they are still very much head over heels in love with each other.</p><p>They have been pictured together countless times outdoors, where they were having fun, and they have also been very vocal about their love for each other whenever they appear at live TV events for interviews.</p><p>Interestingly, Aja and Channing have not lost their love for adventure after all these years. As a matter of fact, it seems they are only just getting started. In July 2022, Channing made a stunning revelation about one of the adventures that he and his wife embarked on, and the revelation stunned many people.</p><p>He revealed that he and his wife actually make sure they go on an adventure to a nudist colony once every year, where they strip down naked in front of several other naked people and just hang out in their birthday suits. He made the revelation during a podcast that had other celebrities, including Kevin Hart, in attendance.
