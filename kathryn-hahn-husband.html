Fans are more than curious to know who Kathryn Hahn's husband is, his job, net worth, information on her children/kids, and all about her family.</strong></p><p>Shaking the world with her role as Agatha Harkness in Marvel's WandaVision, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Kathryn Hahn</strong></a> is a <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>well-known face</a></strong> in Hollywood. Starring as Lily Lebowski in the NBC&nbsp;crime drama series&nbsp;<i>Crossing Jordan</i>, Kathryn began her journey into the golden screen. Receiving quite numerous critical acclaims and a Gotham Award&nbsp;nomination for&nbsp;Best Actress, Kathryn Hahn's popularity is off the charts as well as the interest of the audience around her husband.</p><p>Beginning her career on the television program <i>Hickory Hideout,</i> a local puppet show for children to now having an entire Marvel show Agatha: Coven of Chaos to herself, Kathryn Hahn has walked a long path to rise up to the fame she possesses today. Playing her first leading role, in the comedy-drama film&nbsp;<i>Afternoon Delight,</i> Kathryn had her career breakthrough and ever since ascended towards greatness only.</p><p>While there are quite a lot of interesting things about Kathryn Hahn (including her <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>weight loss</a></strong>), fans want to know about her married life and her husband. With her popularity as an actress increasing, fans are eager to know more about her children and mainly Kathryn Hahn's spouse.</p><p>Previously, we touched on the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>relationship</a></strong> details of <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Lee Hyun-Wook</a></strong> and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Alexandra Breckenridge</a></strong>.</p><h2>Kathryn Hahn's Husband: From College Sweet Hearts to Life Partner, Kathryn Hahn and Ethan Sandler Were Meant to Be!</h2><p><strong>Kathryn Hahn</strong> is tracing her way to success with multiple mind-blowing projects. Amidst this, fans want to know who is the love of her life and all about him.</p><p>Kathryn Hahn's husband is none other than actor, film producer, and writer <strong>Ethan Sandler</strong>. Married since 2002, Kathryn and her husband Ethan have been blessed with two children together,<strong> Leonard</strong> and <strong>Mae</strong>.</p><p>Ethan Sandler has worked in the entertainment world before, just like his wife. He is an actor, producer of movies, and writer best known for his role as ADA Jeffrey Brandau in the Crossing Jordan TV series. Along with these, Sandler appeared in supporting parts in The Princess Diaries, Sex and the City, Will & Grace, and New Girl.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Not just a talented actor, Ethan Sandler is an equally skillful writer and producer. He's produced films like&nbsp;My Boys, Whitney, We Are Men,&nbsp;and shows like&nbsp;New Girl&nbsp;and&nbsp;Man with a Plan while his wife Kathryn supported him in every endeavor.</p><p>At Northwestern University, where they both studied theater, Kathryn and Ethan first crossed paths. The two started living together in the dorms since their connection was so strong right away. In 2002, on the occasion of their tenth anniversary as a couple, the pair opted to elope rather than plan a large wedding, which to some people would even be more romantic.</p><p>Met at quite an early age, Kathryn and her life partner Ethan were together through it all. It's likely that you'll perform in a few plays with your future husband when you first meet him while studying theater, and Kathryn had the chance to do so! Soon after finishing, the two relocated to New York City to start their acting careers.</p><p>Being so in love and always with one another, Kathryn and Ethan starred in the same show with each other at a point in their career. The married pair shared some screen time together in the criminal thriller Crossing Jordan from 2001 until 2007â€”and even then, they were engaged! Ethan portrayed Jeffrey Brandau, who was also engaged to Lily, a role performed by Kathryn. And during the sixth season of the program, Lily conceives Jeffery's kid.</p><p>Ever since her role in WandaVision, Kathryn Hahn's fanbase has grown insanely. Kathryn bumps to "Agatha All Along" during an interview on <a href=# rel=noopener>Late Night With Seth Meyers</a> discussing how getting the role of Agnes/Agatha Harkness on WandaVision enabled her into the Marvel realm with the support of her kids and husband. She revealed,</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>I was able to do a deep dive on Agatha but I needed a little bit of help with the Avengers and going backwards. It was a little bit of a word salad going into this â€¦ my son was especially a huge, huge, help.</p><p>Kathryn and her husband Ethan have been together for over 2 decades with their two children building a happy family. It's also been reported that the couple had garnered a net worth of more than <strong>$2 Million</strong>. When asked about how she feels or describes her family, Kathryn said in an interview,</p><p>I have a pretty normal life, I have cute kids and a hubby forever and two dogs and a rabbit and now a hamster. Weâ€™re turning into animal hoarders. So I have this rich and creative life but also a normal life, and Iâ€™ve been able to keep the two separate and holy.</p><p>Sharing his last name with the famous actor<strong> Adam Sandler</strong>, many wonder if Kathryn Hahn's husband Ethan Sandler and Adam Sandler are related. Sadly, the two don't have any personal connection and just share the same last name. The pair also do not have an Instagram account or any other social media account.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h2 class=heading_title>Agatha: Coven of Chaos to Be Released in Winter of 2023; Hereâ€™s Everything We Know!</h2><p>Agatha: House of Harkness, a spinoff from WandaVision, will debut on Disney+ in the winter of 2023 under the name Agatha: Coven of Chaos. The popular Marvel villain played by <strong>Kathryn Hahn</strong>'s villainous series, which was announced last year, is still shrouded in mystery as to its plot and role in the MCU, but thanks to <strong>Kevin Feige</strong> and his team's massive announcements at <a href=# rel=noopener>San Diego Comic-Con</a>, here's all the information we have on the series.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Agatha will return as part of the Phase 5 lineup of films and Disney+ TV episodes in late 2023, according to the Marvel panel at SDCC, which has been keeping quiet about the spin-off since October 2021.</p><p>Of all, there is still no fresh information regarding the show's plot, but it is anticipated to be a prequel series that explores the character's life before she arrived in Westview. However, the new moniker Coven of Chaos could support this idea or point to Agatha's attempts to use chaos magic in some way following WandaVision.</p><p>With many Phase 5 projects being rapidly released, fans are expecting much from Agatha: Coven of Chaos as to what it brings to the table of chaos and madness that has been going on in MCU.</p><p><strong>Visit <a href=#>Celebs In-depth</a> for more<a href=#> interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGiimqyYp8avecean6dlmKrAo63NnWY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkathryn-hahn-husband.html&text=Job%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Children%2fKids%2c%20Family%20%26amp%3b%20More%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkathryn-hahn-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkathryn-hahn-husband.html&title=Job%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Children%2fKids%2c%20Family%20%26amp%3b%20More%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkathryn-hahn-husband.html&title=Job%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Children%2fKids%2c%20Family%20%26amp%3b%20More%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkathryn-hahn-husband.html&title=Job%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Children%2fKids%2c%20Family%20%26amp%3b%20More%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkathryn-hahn-husband.html&description=Job%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Children%2fKids%2c%20Family%20%26amp%3b%20More%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./telkom-fibre-deals-packages-and-their-prices.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Telkom Fibre Deals, Packages and Their Prices in 2023">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ready-player-one-actor-who-plays-skrull-leader-talos-on-secret-invasion-2-wds-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ready Player One actor who plays Skrull leader Talos on Secret Invasion: 2 wds.">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
