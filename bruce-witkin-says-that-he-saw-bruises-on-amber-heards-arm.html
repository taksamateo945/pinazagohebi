Occasionally vaping in the middle of his questioning, Witkin touched upon themes that pervaded Heard’s case: jealousy, alcohol and drug use, and apparent signs of physical abuse. Witkin acknowledged that he never personally witnessed Depp hitting Heard, but he did identify what he described a finger-shaped bruises on her arm.</p><p>“I mean, it looks similar to that, but it didn’t look like a— It looked like a grab, not a punch, like just someone grabbed her arm,” Witkin said.</p><p>The ex-bandmate emphasized that he only noticed such a bruise “one time.”</p><p>Though Witkin could not recall a time frame of the observation, he said it coincided with their involvement in a documentary about Rolling Stones musician <strong>Keith Richards</strong>. Heard previously testified in U.K. court proceedings that Depp went on a “<a href=#>24-hour cocaine and whiskey bender</a>” before filming in 2013. A U.K. judge <a href=#>credited</a> the allegation that Depp assaulted her during that time, but Witkin described the bruise as inconsistent with being hit.</p><p>“Like I said, it just looked like she was grabbed,” Witkin said. “That’s what it seems to be finger marks.”</p><p>Asked whether he ever spoke to Heard about the marks, Witkin said: “No.”</p><p>Depp and Heard’s brief marriage officially lasted from 2015 and 2017, when their $7 million divorce settlement finalized. But Heard filed for a restraining order in May 2016, when her domestic abuse allegations first went public.</p><p>In December 2018, Heard wrote a Washington Post op-ed that alluded to those divorce proceedings but did not mention Depp explicitly. Depp sued months later in a $50 million lawsuit alleging defamation by implication. Heard countersued for Depp’s attorney’s characterization of her claims as a “hoax.”</p><p>Before those dueling defamation claims, Witkin said, his longtime friendship with Depp ended with unexplained recriminations.</p><p>“I started to feel a distance and 2017. We had a gig, and I saw him. But he was really kind of distant and kind of fucked up,” Witkin said. “And like, he wrote me this weird text saying I stabbed him in the back and badmouth him, and I’m like, ‘What are you talking about?’ He wouldn’t explain it. And pretty much I haven’t seen him since 2018.”</p><p>He said their communications ended after that.</p><p>“I just can’t get through to him,” Witkin said. “No returned texts. No nothing. No emails. My daughter even got married, and he ignored it.”</p><p>Heard accused Depp of surrounding himself with yes-men more concerned about keeping themselves in his good graces and on his payroll than acting in his best interest. Witkin hinted at that dynamic, too.</p><p>“I think there’s some people behind the scenes talking shit about me because everybody always tried to position themselves, ‘Oh, who’s the best friend and who’s this, that,’ when I was just there to be his friend,” Witkin testified. “And I think there were some lies and all this bullshit about me that he actually believed, which is surprising.”</p><p>Outside the palace intrigue of Depp’s inner circle, Watkins said, one of the Pirates of the Caribbean star’s grievances was clear.</p><p>“I know that he wasn’t happy about my testimony, but I wasn’t going to lie,” he said.</p><p>After Witkin’s testimony, Depp’s former talent agent <strong>Tracey Jacob</strong> said in her video deposition that the actor never has been accused of physically abusing a woman other than Heard.</p><p>(Screenshot via Law&Crime Network)</p><p>Have a tip we should know? <a href=#><span class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=65110c151625090412040b0106170c08004b060a08>[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX5e%2Ftq%2FEZq6irJueu26%2FwLKqZqyYlsFutMRmqpqvXZe%2FtrXSnqpmp55irq6uxKtkoZ2Rp7G0ecCrpGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbruce-witkin-says-that-he-saw-bruises-on-amber-heards-arm.html&text=Bruce%20Witkin%20Says%20That%20He%20Saw%20Bruises%20on%20Amber%20Heard%27s%20Arm&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbruce-witkin-says-that-he-saw-bruises-on-amber-heards-arm.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbruce-witkin-says-that-he-saw-bruises-on-amber-heards-arm.html&title=Bruce%20Witkin%20Says%20That%20He%20Saw%20Bruises%20on%20Amber%20Heard%27s%20Arm" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbruce-witkin-says-that-he-saw-bruises-on-amber-heards-arm.html&title=Bruce%20Witkin%20Says%20That%20He%20Saw%20Bruises%20on%20Amber%20Heard%27s%20Arm" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbruce-witkin-says-that-he-saw-bruises-on-amber-heards-arm.html&title=Bruce%20Witkin%20Says%20That%20He%20Saw%20Bruises%20on%20Amber%20Heard%27s%20Arm" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbruce-witkin-says-that-he-saw-bruises-on-amber-heards-arm.html&description=Bruce%20Witkin%20Says%20That%20He%20Saw%20Bruises%20on%20Amber%20Heard%27s%20Arm" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jennifer-aniston-shares-the-cutest-throwback-pic-of-her-as-a-child-354639.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jennifer Aniston Shares The Cutest Throwback Pic Of Her As A Child">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./columbia-stabbing-puts-spotlight-on-schools-poor-crime-safety-record.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Columbia stabbing puts spotlight on schools poor crime, safety record">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
